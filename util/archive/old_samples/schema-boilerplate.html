<h2>Schema Options (microdata)</h2>
<p>
  This module is also available as a schema.org formatted module. Many
  applications, especially search engines, can benefit greatly from this
  structured data. Pages marked up using microdata enable search engines to
  understand the information on web pages and provide richer search results in
  order to make it easier for users to find relevant information on the web.

<p>
  Using microdata is optional, but highly encouraged. In the source code
  section, samples for plain html and the microdata version are both included.
