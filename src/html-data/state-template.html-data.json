Each section contains a summary element and more body text when opened.\n\nAccordions keep pages clean by hiding information that most people do not need to see.\n\nSample usage:\n```html\n<cagov-accordion>\n  <details>\n    <summary>Add a short, descriptive heading for your topic</summary>\n    <div class=\"accordion-body\">\n      <p>Once open, the content within the accordion should describe the topic in more detail. It should not repeat the heading.</p>\n      <p>This part of the accordion is a great place to link to other resources. Remember, important information and calls to action should live outside of the accordion.</p>\n    </div>\n  </details>\n</cagov-accordion>\n```",
