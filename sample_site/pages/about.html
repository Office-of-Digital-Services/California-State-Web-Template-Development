<nav class="page-navigation"></nav>

<p class="lead">
  The State Web Template is an open source web template maintained by the Office
  of Digital Services within the Department of Technology. Our components are
  designed to enhance the user experience and help digital teams create
  attractive, consistent, and accessible digital products. The State Web
  Template will always be open source, collaborative and evolving.
</p>

<h2>Why our template matters</h2>
<p>
  Digitally connecting Californians to the government services they need has
  become increasingly more critical. Great design is central to succeeding in
  that effort. We offer this web template to help make digital information and
  services easier to use.
</p>

<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>
  Enhance the delivery of digital services for California residents through user
  experience design.
</p>

<h2>Our vision</h2>
<p>
  Create excellent digital state services for California residents that are
  inclusive, accessible and performant.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  A long time ago, the eServices Office was established to lead statewide
  initiatives providing leadership in statewide web policy, CA.gov portal and
  the digital government footprint. We have come a long way but our core vision
  and mission has not changed.
</p>
<p>
  The creation of a statewide web template was a strategy and framework to align
  on California's digital touchpoint. The state web template has evolved from a
  technical toolset to a digital standard and tactical playbook on delivering
  useful, accessible, and performant user experiences.
</p>

<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>
  Over the years, and with each state web template release, we've improved the
  access of online government services with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated best practices</li>
  <li>Responsive design elements</li>
  <li>Web accessibility</li>
  <li>Improved performance</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Version 6 of the State Web Template gets us one step closer to a production
  version of the
  <a href="https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/">
    California Design System
  </a>
  . We are excited to iterate on our digital toolset and evolve the state
  template to a design standard for California. We want to improve the digital
  experience of Californians and improve how we partner with State agencies.
